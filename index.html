            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Java is one of the most influential programming languages in history. Known for its versatility, security, and platform independence, it has powered countless applications and systems since its creation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Early Development</h2>
            <p>Java was developed in the early 1990s by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems. Originally called "Oak," it was intended for interactive television but later adapted for broader use. Its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy set it apart from other programming languages.</p>
